How to setup the GameAnalytics Unity SDK for iOS:

When you build your project for iOS, XCode may complain about some missing imports in the GA_UserID.mm file. To fix this go to the Build Phases tab of your Unity-iPhone project inside XCode, and fold out the Link Binary With Libraries section. Click the (+) button and add the AdSupport.framework.

(The above setup is designed for games that show ads (either using GameAnalytics built-in Ad Support, or another ad service). If your game does not show ads please refer to our online documentation for additional information: http://support.gameanalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/200841426-Building-for-iOS-in-Unity.)
